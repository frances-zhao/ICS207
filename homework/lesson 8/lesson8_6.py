#Description: Write a program to check if one number is factor of another.
#If the user does not enter a positive integer prompt them again (and again andâ€¦) until they do. 
#For the second number you should also ensure the value they enter is not more than the
#first number.

#input: prompting the user for a second number that is less than the first
while num_2 <= 0 or num_1 <num_2:
    num_2 = int(input("Please enter another positive integer that is less than the first integer: "))
   
#process + output: checking to see if one is the factor of another an outputting result
